# Flappy-Bird-Game-using-Python
I have developed a Game Flappy Bird using  Python programming language.
This project is a Python-based recreation of the classic Flappy Bird game using the Pygame library. The game challenges players to control a bird, navigating it through obstacles (pipes) by flapping its wings while avoiding collisions with the pipes or the ground. It features smooth animations, responsive controls, collision detection, and scoring mechanics, making the gameplay engaging and fun. The project includes all necessary assets such as images for the background, bird, ground, and pipes, as well as sound effects for actions like flapping, scoring, and game over. Players can restart the game after a collision by clicking the on-screen restart button. This project is a great way to learn and demonstrate game development concepts in Python, including event handling, animations, physics simulation, and user interaction. It is easy to set up and run, requiring Python 3.8 or higher and the Pygame library.
